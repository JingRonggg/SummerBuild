### üöÄ `mvn flyway:migrate`

**Purpose:**  
Applies all pending migration scripts to the database.

**When to use:**
- After adding a new migration SQL file
- When syncing your local DB schema with the latest version
- On application startup (if auto-run is configured in Spring Boot)

**Command:**
```bash
mvn flyway:migrate

```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è `mvn flyway:clean` ‚Äî Use with Caution

**üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When to Use**

Only use `flyway:clean` in **development or testing environments**:

- To **wipe** the database and start from scratch
- When schema changes or migrations are broken and unrecoverable
- Before re-running a full migration set for a clean slate
